# CT60A0203 Ohjelmoinnin perusteet
This is repository for my course I completed in LUT University while doing my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.

This contains my CT60A0203 Ohjelmoinnin perusteet (Basics of Programming) course work (LUT University). The course is worth six (6) ECTS.
All of in here is my first touch in coding.

## Learning Objectives

After completing the course, I learned/am able to:

    1. Create small programs in the Python programming language using basic commands and structures, such as lists and classes.

    2. Develop a program structure composed of subroutines and libraries that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

    3. Create Python programs that can read data shared in CSV format, select relevant information, and perform basic analyses on the data.

    4. Perform basic testing and quality assessment of a program.
