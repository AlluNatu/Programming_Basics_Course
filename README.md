This is repository for my course I completed in LUT University while doing my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.

This contains my CT60A0203 Ohjelmoinnin perusteet (Basics of Programming) course work (LUT University). All of in here is my first touch in coding.

## Learning Objectives

After completing the course, I learned/am able to:
